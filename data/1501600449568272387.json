One in-between suggestion, take the preprocessed data and renormalize, so add additional steps to the end of your standardized pipeline to optimize for additional questions.","created_at":"2022-03-10T13:37:10.000Z","conversation_id":"1501600449568272387"},{"author_id":"778720471789338624","in_reply_to_user_id":"22107961","id":"1501897247201632257","text":"@vdcalhoun @tdverstynen @fmrib_steve The processing pipeline (which was developed when there was no prospect of longitudinal data) treats every imaging session in isolation.
