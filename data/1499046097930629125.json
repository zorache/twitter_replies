It’s compared to the deaths at the  comparable month. Also, I don’t want to blind you with science, but in New Zealand they have summer at a different time to us. So the peaks you see in February are actually their summer.","id":"1499146910241804295"},{"created_at":"2022-03-02T22:16:02.000Z","author_id":"545144286","conversation_id":"1499046097930629125","in_reply_to_user_id":"24873392","text":"@whippletom But you’re the one trying to attack others who simply see through the data you cannot even read.
