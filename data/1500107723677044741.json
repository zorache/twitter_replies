Still a tiny bit breathless but plan to do some more running this week which should help. It's the last crap on my chest and blocked nose every morning.

Bit slower than my last run of 26:20 there but considering I was having classic covid symptoms without being covid. Pcr and lateral flow negative. Had fatigue breathless etc. Pleased with the time.
