            "@JohnnyDrag @ChaseTettleton @howappealing @MatthewStiegler @finedr1965 It could be that there was truly some understandable misunderstanding that came out through the responses to the order to show cause.  The Court seemed to accept good faith given no discipline. But given what the Court knew at the time, an OTSC was more than reasonable.",
            "@ChaseTettleton @smmarotta @howappealing @MatthewStiegler @finedr1965 The key fact here is that they moved to have the extra people show up, and the Federal Circuit denied the motion. Then the people showed up.",

The excercise of power for its own sake isn\u2019t a good look in my humble opinion. \n\nThe Federal courts have a well-deserved reputation as inhospitable.",
            "@ChaseTettleton @JohnnyDrag @howappealing @MatthewStiegler @finedr1965 The Court, I presume, wanted to make it clear that it meant what it said in its protocols.  Putting the fear of God in some attorneys is how you do that.",

            "@howappealing @smmarotta @MatthewStiegler @finedr1965 If we have the right case, it seems they didn't appreciate the new rules, filed the motion last-minute, and may have been on planes or darn close when the motion was denied. I see a lot of folks get lost at the Fed Cir (but not exhibit such bad judgment).",
            "@howappealing @smmarotta @MatthewStiegler @finedr1965 No.  You can get there with carefully-selected search terms in PACER, and then confirm it with some of the facts in the order. But now I'll check the MP3.",
