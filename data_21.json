The group I was supervising all tried to keep the environment as similar as possible. Additionally each student did at least one of the same concentrations so we could standardise, but we found it wasn\u2019t really needed \u263a\ufe0f",
            "@IzzyCBarker @UoBChemistry @cravenphilip1 @chembameditor This is very interesting! My question is, how did you factor in home-to-home variability so that it can be minimised? Or was it negligible ab initio? Loving your work! :)",
            "@ganshermer @UoBChemistry @cravenphilip1 @chembameditor I\u2019d like to see if this experiment could work as a more hybrid approach, with students having the flexibility to choose where to do the experiment (either in the lab or at home) but with the ability to have discussions in person as I find these always work better than Zoom (3\/3)",
            "@ganshermer @UoBChemistry @cravenphilip1 @chembameditor Students were interacting with people they may not have met in person so there were definitely anxieties around speaking in Zoom meetings and I think this may have impacted the group discussions for the second part. (2\/3)",
            "@ganshermer @UoBChemistry @cravenphilip1 @chembameditor I think in some ways there was improvements as the set-up was relatively simple and the pace of the experiment was relaxed but I think the online only format had its own issues. (1\/3)",
            "@DrNMistry @UoBChemistry @cravenphilip1 @chembameditor Definitely! All the experimental part was done individually with groups pooling their results, so it could be up to each student where they did the actual experiment. The group meetings were via Zoom, so these could easily be arranged online or in-person to fit around schedules.",
            "@IzzyCBarker @UoBChemistry @cravenphilip1 @chembameditor Very in-cress-ive (sorry!). Do you think this could work by giving students the choice by doing this at uni or at home? Thinking of students who commute for example.",
            "@IzzyCBarker @UoBChemistry @cravenphilip1 @chembameditor This looks like a great activity with some really nice results. One thing that I find is students are often anxious and feel pressured in the lab environment. Did you get any sense that this was eased? What are your plans to use this in the future now you have the kits?"
