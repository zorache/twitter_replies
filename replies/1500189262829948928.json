Good question! They'll receive funding based only on average enrollment, and stop being penalized when kids are absent or stay home sick, which should be a positive change for families, and may encourage schools to do more to attract enrollees. https://t.co/utYsq1y3Dv","in_reply_to_user_id":"1162275748368936961","author_id":"100582605","id":"1500425295387451392"},{"created_at":"2022-03-06T10:51:12.000Z","conversation_id":"1500189262829948928","text":"@MightyM55070329 @Mary07598877 True.
