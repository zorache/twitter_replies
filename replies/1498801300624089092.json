Cats can catch Covid and sometimes sadly die from it, but we are not yet seeing mutations to any great extent when they do catch it. That means there’s less risk of passing a new variant back to us. That’s probably not true for all species.","id":"1498994309999300615"},{"created_at":"2022-03-02T07:25:39.000Z","author_id":"1295802006263586817","conversation_id":"1498801300624089092","in_reply_to_user_id":"732787392722182144","text":"@DelthiaRicks @mhroseman \uD83D\uDE31","id":"1498922469213622274"},{"created_at":"2022-03-02T02:40:43.000Z","author_id":"1141340430514003968","conversation_id":"1498801300624089092","in_reply_to_user_id":"732787392722182144","text":"@DelthiaRicks Humans infect cats. Not new news, but reason why humans infected with Covid should avoid their cats while infectious. Cats are not significant sources of infection for humans and not sites for mutations. That is all continued good news.","id":"1498850759659560961"},{"created_at":"2022-03-01T23:36:31.000Z","author_id":"874549382","conversation_id":"1498801300624089092","in_reply_to_user_id":"732787392722182144","text":"@DelthiaRicks Poor baby! \uD83D\uDE22","id":"1498804408150339587"}],"meta":{"newest_id":"1498994309999300615","oldest_id":"1498804408150339587","result_count":4}}
